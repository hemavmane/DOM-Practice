// JavaScript is the world most popular lightweight, interpreted
//  compiled programming language. It is also known as scripting 
//  language for web pages. It is well-known for the development of 
//  web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript
//   can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-
// side developments.

// JavaScript can be added to your HTML file in two ways:

// Internal JS: We can add JavaScript
//  directly to our HTML file by writing
//  the code inside the <script> tag.
//  The <script> tag can either be placed inside the <head> or 
//  the <body> tag according to the requirement.
// External JS: We can write JavaScript 
// code in other file having an extension .js and
//  then link this file inside the <head> tag of the HTML 
//  file in which we want to add this code.


// Lodash :-
// is a JavaScript library 
//  works on the top of underscore.js. 
//  It helps in working with arrays, strings, objects,
//   numbers, etc. It provides us with various inbuilt 
//   functions and uses a functional programming approach 
//   which that coding in JavaScript easier to understand 
//   because instead of writing repetitive functions, tasks
//    can be accomplished with a single line of code. It also 
//    makes it easier to work with objects in JavaScript if they
//     require a lot 
// of manipulation to be done upon them.
